# BMI Buddy – Mini Console Project

You have just finished **Chapter 3**, where we explored four core Haskell constructs for controlling flow and organising scope:

1. **`if … then … else` expressions**
2. **Guards (`|` syntax)**
3. **`let … in` expressions**
4. **`where` clauses**

Your task is to design a small **command‑line app**—**BMI Buddy**—that applies *all four* constructs in a meaningful way while solving a real‑life problem: quickly estimating a person’s Body‑Mass Index (BMI) and, if requested, a daily calorie requirement.

### **Objectives**

By completing this Marathon you will be able to:

* Decide when each conditional‑scoping feature (`if`, guards, `let`, `where`) is most readable.
* Write pure functions that work with user input from `IO`.
* Combine pattern‑matching, guards, and local bindings to keep code concise and expressive.
* Deliver a runnable console program and document its usage in a README file.
