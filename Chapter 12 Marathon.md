# Quick Split – Mini Console Project

You have just completed **Chapter 12**, where we focussed on getting a modern Haskell environment up and running and writing our very first program:

1. **Installing GHCup**
2. **Installing GHC, Cabal, Stack, and Haskell Language Server (HLS)** with GHCup
3. **Adding VS Code extensions** for a smooth editing experience
4. **Writing the simplest Haskell program** (just one `main` function)
5. **Compiling and running** that program with **`ghc`**, **Cabal**, or **Stack**

Your marathon is to create a small **command‑line app**—**Quick Split**—that helps friends split a restaurant bill and calculate tip per person. The assignment must walk through Chapter 12 steps: from installing tools to running the finished executable.

### **objectives**

By completing this Marathon you will be able to:

* **Install** the full Haskell toolchain with **GHCup** on your OS of choice.
* **Configure VS Code** (or another editor) with the Haskell extension powered by **HLS**.
* **Write** a minimal but useful program in a single `Main.hs` file that reads input, performs arithmetic, and prints results.
* **Compile and run** your code three ways:

  1. directly with `ghc`,
  2. inside a **Cabal** project, and
  3. inside a **Stack** project.
* Provide a short **README** that explains exactly which commands you used for each toolchain, so a user can reproduce your setup on their machine.
