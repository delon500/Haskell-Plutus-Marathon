# Budget Advisor Exploration-Focused Edition - Mini Console Project

You're building a Budget Advisor mini marathon that helps users understand their income and spending habits. Users enter a list of entries (positive numbers for income, negative for expenses) with categories.

---

## Description

In this console-based Budget Advisor, students will help users manage income and expenses by category. But beyond implementing a working solution, this project encourages students to **explore and experiment** using:

- **REPL** for interactive development
- **Hackage** for discovering useful packages
- **Hoogle** for type-driven search
- **Type holes** (`_`) to guide type inference
- Use of `undefined` as scaffolding during development

You will combine **exploratory programming techniques** with **clean design and logic** to build a real-world budgeting tool.

## Objectives

By completing this marathon, you will:

- Use the **GHCi REPL** to define, test, and inspect functions during development.
- Use **Hoogle** to look up functions by type (e.g., merging, filtering, folding).
- Explore **Hackage** to find and read documentation for useful libraries.
- Use **type holes** (`_`) to discover what types are expected during function definition.
- Temporarily use `undefined` as a placeholder to enable incremental development.
- Gain confidence in building real applications while staying exploratory and type-driven.
