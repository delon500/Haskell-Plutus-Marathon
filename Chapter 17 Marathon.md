# Grocery List Manager - Mini Console Project

## Description

Create a console-based Grocery List Manager that allows users to build, merge, and summarize grocery lists. The system should allow:

- Creating multiple lists of grocery items.
- Merging lists (e.g., combining lists from different family members).
- Accumulating quantities of duplicate items.
- Displaying the final merged list clearly.

The marathon uses **Semigroup** and **Monoid** abstractions to combine data in a clean, reusable wayâ€”illustrating how **abstracting patterns** leads to expressive, composable code.

## Objectives

By completing this Marathon, you will:

- Understand **what it means to abstract a pattern** in real-world programming.
- Recognize **why abstracting patterns** (like combining lists or merging items) improves reusability and clarity.
- Get a teaser of how **Semigroup** and **Monoid** naturally capture combination logic.
- Define and implement the **Semigroup** type class to describe how grocery items and lists can be merged.
- Define and implement the **Monoid** type class, using an identity (empty) grocery list.
- Solve practical problems like **duplicate resolution**, **quantity accumulation**, and **reusability of combination logic**.
